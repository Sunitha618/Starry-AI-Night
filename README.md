Starry-AI-Night
==============================

Vincent van Gogh's paintings are renowned for their distinctive style, characterized by bold brushstrokes, vibrant colors, and emotive expression. However, creating new artwork in the style of Van Gogh presents a unique challenge, requiring a deep understanding of his artistic techniques and aesthetic sensibilities. In this project, we aim to leverage the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate paintings inspired by Vincent van Gogh's iconic works. Specifically, we will explore the use of a diffusion model in conjunction with a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) to generate new artworks that capture the essence of Van Gogh's style.
