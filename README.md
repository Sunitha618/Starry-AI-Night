Starry-AI-Night
==============================

Generative art, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), has gained significant 
attention in recent years for its ability to create unique and captivating artworks. 
This project proposal outlines the development of a cutting-edge generative art 
system that utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGAN) and diffusion 
models to generate Vincent Van Gogh-like paintings. 

The Starry AI Night project aims to push the boundaries of generative art by 
leveraging advanced AI techniques. By combining research, experimentation, and 
innovation, we seek to create a novel and inspiring platform for generating 
captivating artworks.
